# Johnaconda-ComfyUI-Custom-Nodes
Ok Theese are some Custom Nodes that i like to experiment with and use in ComfyUI.
Most of my work is made by the help of ChatGPT 5. i come up with neat ideas and we cook.

#How to install??
Oh this is easy! you just download the .py file or copy pasta the source into ComfyUi's custom nodes folder:
C:\ComfyUI\custom_nodes <- in here and BAM it should work, if it doesen't comfy probably have patched thier dependancy somehow that messed it up.

# prompt_combiner_node.py
This is a Prompt combiner where it takes above string and second string and add them together.
it's a basic string combiner that allows me to add positives on top and leave em there while i edit the second string field "what to make"
